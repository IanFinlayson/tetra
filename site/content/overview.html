<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>This page gives a brief overview of the Tetra programming language including
the motivation for creating it, as well as the overall design of the language
and features.</p>


<hr />
<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>We are now firmly in the multi core world.  It is virtually impossible to
buy a new computer with only a single processor core in it.  New phones and
tablets have either two or four processor cores, and even small computers such
as the Raspberry Pi now come with four cores.  Nearly every computer that we
interact with is a parallel machine.</p>

<p>Despite this huge shift in the hardware world towards parallelism, there has
not been a similar shift in the software world.  Most programs are still
written in a single-threaded manner with parallel programming relegated to
niches such as scientific computing, systems development and high performance
games.</p>

<p>There are several reasons for this.  One of them is that our programming
languages and tools are, for the most part, still geared towards sequential
programming.  Most languages do not include syntax support for parallel
programming which makes it more difficult than it should be.  Tools like
debuggers are also geared primarily for single-threaded programming.  Some
aspects of parallel programming are inherently difficult, but some of the
difficulty comes from our tools not being suited to the task.</p>

<hr />
<h3>Parallelism Built In</h3>

<p>The main feature that distinguishes Tetra from most programming languages is
that parallelism is a first-class language feature.  It has syntax support for
specifying that statements run in parallel, or in the background.  Most
languages instead use libraries to support parallelism.  To see why this makes
a difference, consider the following Python program which computes the sum of a
range of numbers:</P>

<pre>
total = 0

def sum_range(numbers, a, b):
    i = a
    while i &lt;= b:
        global total
        total = total + numbers[i]
        i = i + 1

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
sum_range(numbers, 0, 9)
print(total)
</pre>

<p>Now suppose we wish to parallelize this so that two threads each added half
of the numbers.  In Python, we'd have to use the threading library like so:</p>

<pre>
<b>from threading import Thread, Lock</b>

total = 0
<b>lock = Lock( )</b>

def sum_range(numbers, a, b):
    i = a
    while i &lt;= b:
        global total
        <b>lock.acquire( )</b>
        total = total + numbers[i]
        <b>lock.release( )</b>
        i = i + 1

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
<b>t1 = Thread(target = sum_range, args = (numbers, 0, 4))</b>
<b>t1.start( )</b>

<b>t2 = Thread(target = sum_range, args = (numbers, 5, 9))</b>
<b>t2.start( )</b>

<b>t1.join( )</b>
<b>t2.join( )</b>
print(total)
</pre>

<p>The code related to specifying what should be done in parallel, and what
cannot be is in bold.  Notice that it takes over twice as many lines as the
original sequential program.  Not only is this rather tedious, but it is also
error-prone.  If we forget to join one of the threads, we will have a race
condition which is quite difficult to debug.</p>

<p>Now, consider the same sequential sum program, but in Tetra:</p>

<pre>
<code>
global total = 0

def sum_range(numbers [int], a int, b int):
    i = a
    while i &lt;= b:
        total = total + numbers[i]
        i = i + 1

def main( ):
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    sum_range(numbers, 0, 9)
    print(total)
</code>
</pre>

<p>The syntax of Tetra is quite close to that of Python.  The major differences
are that Tetra requires a main function, and Tetra is statically typed.</p>

<p>The bigger difference, however, is that parallelizing this Tetra program is
much easier.  It can be done as follows:</p>

<!-- hard coded syntax due to bolds :( -->

<!--
global total = 0

def sum_range(numbers [int], a int, b int):
    i = a
    while i &lt;= b:
        lock total_lock:
        total = total + numbers[i]
        i = i + 1

def main( ):
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    parallel:
        sum_range(numbers, 0, 4)
        sum_range(numbers, 5, 9)
    print(total)
-->
<pre>
<span class='tetra-key'>global</span> total = <span class="tetra-value">0</span>

<span class='tetra-key'>def</span> sum_range(numbers [<span class='tetra-type'>int</span>], a <span class='tetra-type'>int</span>, b <span class='tetra-type'>int</span>):
    i = a
    <span class='tetra-key'>while</span> i &lt;= b:
        <b><span class='tetra-key'>lock</span> total_lock:</b>
            total = total + numbers[i]
            i = i + <span class="tetra-value">1</span>

<span class='tetra-key'>def</span> main( ):
    numbers = [<span class="tetra-value">1</span>, <span class="tetra-value">2</span>, <span class="tetra-value">3</span>, <span class="tetra-value">4</span>, <span class="tetra-value">5</span>, <span class="tetra-value">6</span>, <span class="tetra-value">7</span>, <span class="tetra-value">8</span>, <span class="tetra-value">9</span>, <span class="tetra-value">10</span>]
    <b><span class='tetra-key'>parallel</span>:</b>
        sum_range(numbers, <span class="tetra-value">0</span>, <span class="tetra-value">4</span>)
        sum_range(numbers, <span class="tetra-value">5</span>, <span class="tetra-value">9</span>)
    <span class='tetra-builtin'>print</span>(total)
</pre>

<p>Again, the added lines appear in bold.  Because Tetra has built-in syntax
for parallelism, there are only two lines to add.  The parallel keyword creates
a new block of code.  Each statement in that block is launched in a new thread.
Each thread is automatically joined at the end of the parallel block.  The lock
statement also creates a new block which gives a critical section.  There is no
need to explicitly release the lock - it is automatically released at the end
of the block.</p>

<p>Having syntactical support for parallelism makes it easier and less
error-prone to use.</p>



<hr />
<h3>Designed for Education</h3>

<p>Another reason that parallelism hasn't been widely embraced by the software
world is that it is still not a large part of most computer science
curriculums, despite several calls for it to be emphasized more.</p>

<p>One barrier to doing this is that most programming languages used for
teaching programming, such as Python and Java, do not include parallelism as a
built-in feature.  The most widely used language, Python, is especially bad for
parallelism because, in addition to lacking syntax for it, Python uses a
"global interpreter lock" which actually prevents multiple threads from running
at the same time.</p>

<p>On the other side of things, the languages which <i>do</i> have good support
for parallelism, such as C and Fortran, are not widely used for introductory
classes and can be difficult even for experienced programmers.</p>

<p>Tetra is designed to fill the niche of a language that is designed with
parallel programming in mind, but which prioritizes ease of use over
performance.  It does this by including built-in data structures, garbage
collection, and a simple syntax.</p>
