<h3>First Tetra Paper Published</h3>
<i>July 17, 2015</i>

<p>The first paper on Tetra was published at the 5th NSF/TCPP Workshop on Parallel 
and Distributed Computing Education.  The paper discusses the idea behind the 
language, and the current state of the implementation.  It is accessible here.
There is still a lot of work to do before a “0.1” release of the language, but 
it is beginning to take shape.</p>

<h3>Web Site Launch</h3>
<i>December 18, 2013</i>

<p>Thanks to the UMW Domain of One’s Own program, Tetra has a fancy new web site. 
The project is still in the early stages, but I will be updating this site with 
progress on the language and tools as they are developed.</p>
