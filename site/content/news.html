<h3>Tetra 0.1 Release</h3>
<i>March 3, 2016</i>

<p>There are going to be big changes coming to the language this summer,
so we are officially calling the current state 0.1.  It is usable in the
strictest sense of the word, but is missing a lot of the niceties you
would expect in a modern programming language.  On to 0.2!</p>

<h3>First Tetra Paper Published</h3>
<i>July 17, 2015</i>

<p>The first paper on Tetra was published at the 5th NSF/TCPP Workshop on
Parallel and Distributed Computing Education.  The paper discusses the idea
behind the language, and the current state of the implementation.  It is <a
href="http://cs.umw.edu/~finlayson/papers/edupar15.pdf">accessible here</a>.
There is still a lot of work to do before a "0.1" release of the language, but
it is beginning to take shape.</p>

<h3>Web Site Launch</h3>
<i>December 18, 2013</i>

<p>Thanks to the UMW Domain of One's Own program, Tetra has a fancy new web site. 
The project is still in the early stages, but I will be updating this site with 
progress on the language and tools as they are developed.</p>
