<h1>Language Reference</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This page documents the syntax and semantics of the Tetra language.  The
page does not provide a formal specification, but an informal one.  For a
formal syntax specification, see the parser.y file in the Tetra code.</p>

<p>The goal of this page is to provide more detailed information than is
given in the tutorial or descriptor pages.</p>



<hr />
<h3>Program Structure</h3>

<p>Tetra programs are made of several top-level elements.  These can be functions,
classes, constants or globals.</p>

<p>Constants consist of the keyword <tt>constant</tt>, followed by the name of the
constant variable, followed by an assignment to a value.  Below is an example:</p>

<pre>
<code>
constant E = 2.718281828
</code>
</pre>

<p>Globals are similar, except they use the <tt>global</tt> keyword, and do not
require an assignment.  If a global does not contain an assignment, it must be given
a type.  Below are two examples of globals:</p>

<pre>
<code>
global x = 4.0
global y as real
</code>
</pre>

<p>Comments in Tetra begin with an octothorpe (#) and continue until the end
of the line.</p>

<h3>Types</h3>

<p>All variable types are known to the Tetra interpreter before the program
is executed.  This means that each newly introduced variables must either be
assigned an initial value, or have a type declared.  Tetra types can be any of
the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A built-in type (specified with just the name of the type):
<ul>
<li><tt>int</tt></li>
<li><tt>real</tt></li>
<li><tt>string</tt></li>
<li><tt>bool</tt></li>
<li><tt>mutex</tt></li>
<li><tt>task</tt></li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>A list of any type.  Lists are specified as the component type
of the list inside of square brackets.  For instance, a list of strings
would be specified as <tt>[string]</tt></li>
<li>A tuple containing any number of elements of other types.  These
are specified by listing the component types inside of parenthesis, separated
by commas.  For example, a tuple containing an integer, a string, and a bool
would be given as <tt>(int, string, bool)</tt>.</li>
<li>A dictionary mapping one type to another.  These are specified by providing
the type of the keys and values, inside of curly braces, separated by a colon.
For instance, a dictionary mapping strings to mutexes would be specified as
<tt>{string : mutex}</tt>.</li>
<li>A function type.  These are specified by listing the parameters to the
function, in the same format as a tuple, followed by the <tt>-&gt;</tt>
symbol, followed by the return type.  For instance, a function which
takes a list of integers and a string, and returns a real would be specified
<tt>([string], string) -&gt; real</tt>.</li>
<li>An identifier name which refers to a class.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the above refer to specifying a type in a declaration only.</p>




<hr />
<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>Functions in Tetra are created with the <tt>def</tt> keyword, followed by the
name of the function, followed by the parameter list, followed by a colon, and then
a new line.  After that comes the body of the function which is indented one level.</p>

<p>Below is an example of a function which takes two integers and returns the sum:</p>

<pre>
<code>
def sum(a int, b int) int:
    return a + b
</code>
</pre>

<p>Note that the types follow parameter names, and that the return type is
between the closing parenthesis and colon.</p>

<p>If the function returns no value, then the return type is simply omitted.</p>




<hr />
<h3>Indentation</h3>

<p>Tetra uses indentation to delimit blocks, as seen in the function example
above.  The indentation must be some number of spaces - tab characters are
illegal in Tetra code.  The interpreter does not care how many spaces you use
to indent so long as you are consistent.</p>

<p>The interpreter finds the first indented block in your program and uses the
amount of spaces you used as the indentation level.  You must use this same amount
of indentation level each subsequent time you indent, to use more or less will
cause a syntax error.</p>



<hr />
<h3>Scope</h3>

<p>Unlike some languages, Tetra does not treat each block of code as its own
scope.  Instead, each function contains one scope, regardless of how many indented
blocks it contains.  There is also one global scope which contains the constant
and global declarations.</p>





<hr />
<h3>Statements</h3>

<p>A function body is made up of statements.  These can either be a "simple
statement" or a "compound statement".  The difference is that multiple simple
statements can be combined in one line, separated by semi-colons.</p>

<p>The simple statements are:</p>

<ul>

<li><tt>pass</tt> - this statement does nothing and has limited value except
for specifying an empty loop or function body.</li>

<li><tt>break</tt> - this statement causes the interpreter to halt the most
closely nested loop that the break statement appears in.</li>

<li><tt>continue</tt> - this statement causes the interpreter to go back to the
start of the most closely nested loop that the break statement appears in.  If
it is a for loop, the for variable will be assigned a new value before
restarting the loop.</li>

<li><tt>return</tt> - This statement causes the interpreter to stop the
currently executing function and return control back to the caller.  If the
return statement is given a value, then this value is returned to the
caller.</li>

<li><tt>wait</tt> - This statement is given a <tt>task</tt> object.  It will
cause the current thread to pause until the specified task completes.</li>

<li><tt>Any expression</tt> - any expression (described below) can be used as a
statement.  Most frequently these will be assignments or function calls.</li>

</ul>

<p>The compound statements ate:</p>


<ul>

<li><tt>if</tt> - this statement is followed by an expression which should
produce a boolean value, followed by a colon, and then an indented code block.
If the expression is true, the code block is executed.  If not, it is not.</li>

<li><tt>elif</tt> - this statement can only follow an <tt>if</tt> statement or
another <tt>elif</tt> statement.  Like <tt>if</tt> statements, these contain an
expression followed by a colon, and then an indented block.  An <tt>elif</tt>
condition will only be evaluated <tt>if</tt> all of the <tt>if</tt> and
<tt>elif</tt> conditions above it have evaluated to false.  If the condition
for an <tt>elif</tt> does evaluate to true, then its block is executed.</li>

<li><tt>else</tt> - this statement can optionally follow an <tt>if</tt> or
<tt>elif</tt> statement.  Each <tt>if</tt> block (with or without
<tt>elif</tt>) can have exactly one <tt>else</tt> attached to it.  The
<tt>else</tt> is followed by a colon and an indented block.  If none of the
prior <tt>if</tt> or <tt>elif</tt> conditions have been met, the <tt>else</tt>
block is executed.</li>

<li><tt>while</tt> - this statement contains an expression followed by a colon,
and then an indented block.  The expression is evaluated and, if it is true,
the block is executed.  Then the expression is evaluated again.  This process
is repeated until the condition evaluates to false.</li>

<li><tt>for</tt> - this statement contains an "induction variable", the keyword
<tt>in</tt>, and then an expression which produces a list.  These are followed by
a colon and an indented block.  The induction variable is assigned all of the values
from the list, one by one, and the block is executed with that value.</li>

<li><tt>parallel for</tt> - this statement is identical to a regular <tt>for</tt>
loop, except that all of the loop iterations can be executed in parallel.  The order
and manner in which they are executed is unspecified.</li>

<li><tt>background</tt> - this statement is followed by a colon, and an indented
block.  All of the code in the block is executed in a separate thread.  This thread is
not joined implicitly.  If the <tt>background</tt> statement is given a name (between the
<tt>background</tt> keyword and colon), then a <tt>task</tt> object is created in the current
function.</li>

<li><tt>lock</tt> - this statement is followed by a colon and an indented
block.  The block is executed in a critical section.  So if a different thread
is already executing the same block, then the current thread will stall.  If
the <tt>lock</tt> is given a name, then a <tt>mutex</tt> object is created in
the current function.</li>

<li><tt>parallel</tt> - this statement is followed by a colon and an indented block.
Each statement directly under the <tt>parallel</tt> statement will be executed in an
independent thread.  All of these threads are joined before the <tt>parallel</tt>
statement is complete.</li>

</ul>
