<h1>Tutorial</h1>

<p>This page contains a tutorial introduction to the Tetra programming
Language.  Its intent is to be a quick and straightforward introduction to
Tetra for experienced programmers.</p>


<hr />
<h3>Hello World</h3>

<p>By law and custom, we will begin with the "Hello world" program which in
Tetra can be written as:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# hello world example
def main():
    print("Hello World!")
</code>
</pre>

<p>Comments in Tetra begin with the <code>#</code> character and continue to the
end of the line.  The first line of this program is a comment, and the rest is
the body of the program.</p>

<p>Every Tetra program must contain a function called <code>main</code> which
defines where the program begins executing.  Functions are defined with the
<code>def</code> keyword, then the name of the function, followed by the list of
parameters.  The main function takes no parameters.  The colon character is
used to mark the beginning of the function body which must be indented one
level over.</p>

<p>The <code>print</code> function is used for printing things, so we pass the
string "Hello World!" into it to print it to the screen.</p>



<hr />
<h3>Simple Types</h3>

<p>Tetra contains six simple types.  Each of these is indivisible, but can be
combined up in lists, dictionaries, classes etc. as discussed later on.  The simple
types are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>int</strong></p><p>
An integer type variable which can be positive or negative, but cannot contain
a fractional part.  These are signed 64-bit values.

</p></li>
<li><p><strong>real</strong></p><p>
A real (floating point) number variable which can contain a fractional part.
These are 64-bit values following the IEEE double-precision standard.

</p></li>
<li><p><strong>bool</strong></p><p>
A single boolean value which can store the values either <code>true</code> or
false.

</p></li>
<li><p><strong>string</strong></p><p>
A string is a piece of text.  Strings are stored as a sequence of Unicode
characters.

</p></li></ul>








<hr />
<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>As described above, functions are introduced with the <code>def</code> keyword,
and also have names and parameter lists.  Functions can also return values, and
their return type (if any) goes after the parameter list, but before the
colon.</p>

<p>Below is a function which computes the average of three parameters:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# return the average of three parameters
def average_of_three(v1 real, v2 real, v3 real) real:
    return (v1 + v2 + v3) / 3.0;
</code>
</pre>

<p>Note that types go <i>after</i> their variables and not before.  The
<code>return</code> statement is used to specify the return value of a function and
return control back to the caller.</p>

<p>Functions are called similarly to how they are in most programming
languages, with the values of parameters passed in at the call.  The
<code>average_of_three</code> function above might be called as follows in
main:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# test of the average_of_three function
def main():
    avg = average_of_three(4.5, 7.2, 6.3)
    print(avg)
</code>
</pre>




<hr />
<h3>Variables</h3>

<p>If you look at the example call to <code>average_of_three</code> above, you will
notice that there is no declaration of the type of the <code>avg</code> variable.
Local variables (those which exist only inside of a function) do not need type
declarations in Tetra, the compiler will figure out the type of each based on
how the variable is used.  Only function parameters and return types need to be
given values.</p>

<p>We can declare the type of local variables.  Sometimes this is needed, for
example if we want to create a variable, but don't want to give it an initial
value, we would need to declare the type:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# Tetra will figure out the type
value1 = 5

# we tell Tetra the type
value2 int
</code>
</pre>

<p>We can also declare multiple variables of the same type in one line:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# declare three variables of the real type
x, y, z real
</code>
</pre>



<p>Global variables can also be created, by using the <code>global</code> keyword,
as shown in the following example:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# declare a global variable
global count = 0

# access the global
def increment():
    count += 1

# should print 3
def main( ):
    increment()
    increment()
    increment()
    print(count)
</code>
</pre>

<p>Of course global variables should be avoided in general!</p>

<p>Tetra also allows constant variables to be created with the
<code>constant</code> keyword:</p>

<pre>
<code>
constant PI = 3.141592653589
</code>
</pre>

<p>Notice that globals and constants also do not need type declarations.</p>




<hr />
<h3>Operators</h3>

<p>Tetra supports many common operators.  The following table shows the
operators that Tetra supports organized by precedence levels, from highest
precedence to lowest, along with the associativity:</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-hover">
<tr><th>Operator</th><th>Meaning</th><th>Associativity</th></tr>
<tr><td>**</td><td>Exponentiation</td><td>Right</td></tr>
<tr><td>+ - ~</td><td>Unary plus, unary minus, and unary bitwise not</td><td>Unary</td></tr>
<tr><td>% / *</td><td>Modulus, division, multiplication</td><td>Left</td></tr>
<tr><td>+ -</td><td>Addition and subtraction</td><td>Left</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;</td><td>Bitwise left shift and right shift</td><td>Left</td></tr>
<tr><td>&amp;</td><td>Bitwise and</td><td>Left</td></tr>
<tr><td>^</td><td>Bitwise xor</td><td>Left</td></tr>
<tr><td>&#124;</td><td>Bitwise or</td><td>Left</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt; &lt;= &gt; &gt;= == !=</td><td>Comparison operators</td><td>Left</td></tr>
<tr><td>not</td><td>Logical not</td><td>Unary</td></tr>
<tr><td>and</td><td>Logical and</td><td>Left</td></tr>
<tr><td>or</td><td>Logical or</td><td>Left</td></tr>
<tr><td>=</td><td>Assignment (including +=, -= etc)</td><td>Right</td></tr>
</table>









<hr />
<h3>Selection Statements</h3>

<p>Tetra provides the if, elif, else statements, which work similarly to other
programming languages.  Below is a program which prints out whether a number is
positive, negative, or zero:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# print the sign of the parameter
def print_sign(val int):
    if val &lt; 0:
        print(val, " is negative")
    elif val &gt; 0:
        print(val, " is positive")
    else:
        print(val, " is zero")

def main( ):
    print("Enter a value: ")
    val = read_int()
    print_sign(val)
</code>
</pre>

<P>Notice that the keyword is <code>elif</code> all as one word, and not "else if".
Also, notice that print can take multiple parameters, and that the
<code>read_int</code> function can be used to read an int from the user.</p>





<hr />
<h3>While Loops</h3>

<p>While loops are blocks of code that continue to execute while some condition
is true.  For example, the following function returns the factorial of a number
using a while loop:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# calculate the factorial of a parameter
def fact(x int) int:
    result = 1
    while x &gt; 0:
        result *= x
        x -= 1
    return result
</code>
</pre>

<p>The while loop starts by evaluating its condition and, if true, executes the
body of the loop.  It continues to do this until the condition is false at
which point it will continue to the code after the loop.</p>


<p>Tetra also includes the <code>break</code> keyword, which causes a loop to
immediately exit, the <code>continue</code> keyword, which causes a loop to abort
the current iteration and move on to the next one, and the <code>pass</code>
keyword which has no effect but can be used where a statement is needed.</p>




<hr />
<h3>Parallel Execution</h3>

<p>Normally, Tetra functions are executed sequentially line by line, following
the control flow as dictated by function calls and returns, loops, and
selection statements.  However, we can also specify that statements should be
executed in parallel.</p>

<p>This is done using the <code>parallel</code> keyword, followed by a number of
statements in the parallel block.  For example, this program calls the print
function two times in parallel, and then calls it a third time:</p>

<pre>
<code>
def main():
    # each statement directly under the parallel block executed in parallel
    parallel:
        print("Print statement number 1!\n")
        print("Print statement number 2!\n")
    print("Print statement number 3!\n")
</code>
</pre>

<p>When this program is run, the two print statements will be executed at the
same time.  This program may print the first two messages in any order.
Sometimes the first message appears first, and other times the second one will
appear first.  It is even possible that they will appear inter-leaved, with the
beginning of one message, followed by the beginning of the other, followed by
the ends of each of them</p>

<p>Because the third print call is <i>outside</i> of the parallel block, it
will not start executing until the other two have both completed.</p>

<p>Of course normally we would only execute different pieces of code in
parallel if they can be executed together in any order without changing the
behavior of the program.  For example, we might call multiple functions in
parallel to compute values which are independent of each other:</p>

<pre>
<code>
def main():
    parallel:
        result1 = process(data_set1)
        result2 = process(data_set2)
        result3 = process(data_set3)
    display_results(result1, result2, result3)
</code>
</pre>

<p>Here, the three calls to a function called "process" will proceed in
parallel independently of each other.  When all three have returned, the
program will move past the parallel block to call the "display_results"
function.</p>

<p>Note that the parallel works with <i>statements</i>.  Often the statements
will be function calls, but they do not have to be.  We could run two while
loops in parallel for instance:</p>

<pre>
<code>
def main():
    i = 1
    j = 1
    sum = 0
    product = 1
    # each while loop is done in parallel
    parallel:
        while i &lt; 10:
            sum += i
            i += 1
        while j &lt; 10:
            product *= j
            j += 1
</code>
</pre>

<p>Here, the two while loops are executed in two parallel threads.  Each while
loop itself is implemented sequentially, so this program will compute the sum
and product of the numbers 1-10 in two parallel loops.</p>



<hr />
<h3>Lists</h3>

<p>Lists package together multiple variables of the same type, such that they
can be accessed by an integer index.  Lists are indexed by placing the index
between square brackets after the name of the list.  The following example
program counts the number of times a string appears in a list of strings:</p>

<pre>
<code>
def main( ):
    numbers = [10, 20, 30]
    total = numbers[0] + numbers[1] + numbers[2]
    print(total)
</code>
</pre>

<p>Data type declarations, such as with function parameters, with lists are
done by placing the type of each element in brackets.  For example, the
following function takes a list of numbers and returns whether or not the
length of it is even:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# return true if the length of the list is even
def even_length(values [int]) bool:
    if len(values) % 2 == 0:
        return true
    else:
        return false
</code>
</pre>

<p>Multi-dimensional lists can also be created.  In this case, you would
simply increase the number of brackets in the type.  For example, a 2D list of
reals would be declared as having type <code>[[real]]</code>.</p>


<hr />
<h3>Ranges</h3>

<p>We can create lists containing ranges of integers using the <code>...</code>
operator.  For instance, we can create a list containing the values one to ten
inclusive with:</p>

<pre>
<code>
numbers = [1 ... 10]
</code>
</pre>

<p>This can be done with variables as well.  We could write use a range to
write our factorial function as:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# calculate the factorial using a range
def fact(x int) int:
    result = 1
    for num in [1 ... n]:
        result *= num
    return result
</code>
</pre>






<hr />
<h3>For Loops</h3>

<p>Lists lead us naturally to the Tetra <code>for</code> loop which loop over each
item in a list.  For example, the following function loops over the list it
is given and prints each element:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# print all values in a list being passed in
def print_all(values [int]):
    for value in values:
        print(value, "\n")
</code>
</pre>

<p>This for loop assigns each element in the list that it is given to the loop
variable one by one, then executes the loop body for that particular value.</p>





<hr />
<h3>Parallel For Loops</h3>

<p>We can also use the parallel for loop which is similar to the for loop as
described above, except that it is preceded with the <code>parallel</code> keyword,
and each of its loop iterations can be executed in parallel.</p>

<p>If we make the for loop above into a parallel for loop, then the calls to
print can be executed all at the same time and so can appear inter-leaved and
in any order.  Calling the function with the values 1 through 100, as in this
program:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# print all values in a list in parallel
def print_all(values [int]):
    parallel for value in values:
        print(value, "\n")

def main():
    print_all([1 ... 100])
</code>
</pre>

<p>Produces different results at each run.  The beginning of one run is shown
below:</p>

<pre>
13
4
2
6

7
8
10
11
12
91314

15
16
</pre>

<p>Notice that the results are not only out of order, but in this case
inter-leaved since sometimes multiple numbers get printed back to back, and
sometimes multiple new lines are printed back to back.</p>

<p>We would only want to use parallel for loops when the order of the loop
iterations is not important for the program to be correct.  As an example,
suppose we are writing a function which takes a list of numbers and returns
a list of those numbers squared.  Here, each of the elements can be computed
independently, and so could be done with a parallel for loop:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# returns the squares of an array as another array
def square_all(values [real]) [real]:
    squares [real] = list(len(values))
    parallel for i in [0 ... len(values) - 1]:
        squares[i] = values[i] * values[i]
    return squares
</code>
</pre>

<p>The <code>list</code> function creates a list of a given size.</p>





<hr />
<h3>Background Execution</h3>

<p>The <code>parallel</code> keyword can be used to launch multiple statements at
the same time, which allows the original thread to launch multiple tasks at
once, and pause until they are done.</p>

<p>Something else we might want to do is have a thread launch one task which
begins executing, but the returns control back to the original thread
immediately.  For instance, we may want to launch a long-running task, but not
wait for it to finish immediately so we can move on to other things, such as
handling user input.</p>

<p>This can be done with Tetra using the <code>background</code> statement.  The
following program shows how this may be done to write a simple server type of
program:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# a simple server type program
def main():
    while true:
        request = wait_for_request()
        background:
            print("Handling a request!")
            handle_request(request)
</code>
</pre>

<p>This program uses a background block to handle each request it receives in a
separate thread of execution.  After the wait_for_request function returns, the
program will launch a thread to handle the background block's body, and then
immediately call wait_for_request again.</p>

<p>Note that the two statements inside the background block are executed
serially: first the print will execute and then the handle_request function
will be called.</p>



<hr />
<h3>Waiting</h3>

<p>Sometimes we may want to launch a thread in the background, but then wait
for it to finish executing at some later point in time.  For instance, suppose
we are writing a program which needs to download some data for use, but that it
can start the download before it really needs the data.  We can use a
background block with <code>wait</code> statement to implement this:</p>

<pre>
<code>
def main():
    background download_task:
        data = download_data()

    # do other things that don't need the data
    # ...
    
    wait download_task

    # now we use the data we got
</code>
</pre>

<p>Here we have given the background block a name, "download_task".  After
launching the task in the background, we can carry on doing things which don't
require the data.  Once we <i>do</i> need the data, we wait for it with the
<code>wait</code> statement which takes the task we wish to wait for.</p>

<p>If the task has finished already, the wait statement takes no time at all.
If it hasn't finished, it will not complete until the task we're waiting for
has completed.</p>

<p>The named background statement creates a variable of type <code>task</code>
which is first class data type in Tetra.  This means we can return tasks from
functions, put them in data structures etc.</p>





<hr />
<h3>Locks</h3>

<p>Sometimes when we have parallel code, we will need to prevent the threads
from interfering with each other.  For instance, if we are trying to find the
largest value in a list, we may keep track of the largest value we have seen
so far:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# find the max of a list
def max(nums [int]) int:
    largest = 0
    parallel for num in nums:
        if num &gt; largest:
            largest = num
    return largest
</code>
</pre>

<p>However, this program may produce the wrong answer because two threads may
execute the if condition at the same time, and both may find they have a value
which is larger than then current largest.  We would then have a situation
where only one of the threads actually writes its value, meaning one will be
lost, which may in fact have been the maximum.</p>

<p>To get around this, we put a lock statement around the code which updates
the largest:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# find the max of a list
def max(nums [int]) int:
    largest = 0
    parallel for num in nums:
        if num &gt; largest:
            lock:
                if num &gt; largest:
                    largest = num
    return largest
</code>
</pre>

<p>The lock statement creates a block of code which only one thread can enter
at a time.  Now, all of the threads can check if their value is larger than the
current largest, in parallel.  Once one finds that its value is in fact larger,
it tries to enter the block of code under the lock.  If another thread is
already in the block, the thread waits until it has finished before entering.
The thread then checks if its value is <i>still</i> larger than the current
largest (because it's possible a thread which just left the lock has modified
it since the last check) and then overwrites the largest variable.</p>

<p>The lock statement allows creating sections of our program which only one
thread can enter at a time which is often necessary when writing parallel
code.</P>



<hr />
<h3>Named Locks</h3>

<p>Sometimes it is necessary to have multiple sections of code which are locked
together.  For instance if we have a variable or resource that is being
accessed at multiple points in the program, we would want to have those locks
linked together, such that no more than one thread can be in <i>any</i> of
those sections at a time.</p>

<p>For instance the following program uses a global lock variable to prevent
two functions from over-writing the "negatives" value at the same time:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# demonstrates a named lock
def main():
    negatives = 0

    parallel:
        for i in data1:
            if i &lt; 0:
                lock neg_lock:
                    negatives += 1
        for i in data2:
            if i &lt; 0:
                lock neg_lock:
                    negatives += 1
    print("There were ", negatives, " negative values.")
</code>
</pre>

<p>In this example, we are checking two sets of values for negative numbers in
parallel.  We have to protect the negatives variable, but it is accessed in two
distinct places in the code.  The fact that the locks are both named "neg_lock"
ensures that they are linked together.  Only one thread can be in <i>either</i>
block at the same time.</p>

<p>The named lock statement actually creates a variable of the <code>mutex</code>
type.  We can lock an existing mutex variable which has been declared elsewhere.
For instance the following program uses a global mutex to allow two separate
functions to make sure that they call print separately to avoid the issue of
inter-leaved output:

<pre>
<code>
# here the named lock is shared amongst functions, so is global
global print_lock mutex

def f1():
    # ...
    lock print_lock:
        print("Function 1 says hi!")
    # ...

def f2():
    # ...
    lock print_lock:
        print("Function 2 says hi!")
    # ...
</code>
</pre>



<hr />
<h3>Tuples</h3>

<p>In addition to lists, Tetra includes a tuple type which can also group
multiple pieces of data together.  Unlike a list, a tuple can contain elements
of different types.  For example, we cannot store an int and a string together
in a list, but we can in a tuple.</p>

<p>Another difference between lists and tuples is that lists of any length
can be passed into a function, defined as variables etc. while tuples have the
number (and type) of their elements fixed as part of their type.  For instance,
we can write a function which takes a list of strings of any size, but a
function which takes a tuple must specify its length.</p>

<p>Below we have a function which takes a tuple containing a string and an int,
and then call it in main:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# takes a tuple and prints it to the screen
def print_info(info (string, int)):
    print("Name is ", info[0])
    print("Age is ", info[1])

def main():
    info = ("Bob", 42)
    print_info(info)
</code>
</pre>

<p>Notice that parentheses are used to declare the type of a tuple, and also
to give the value of one.</p>

<p>Tuples can also be returned from a function which allows functions to
effectively have multiple return values.  The following function returns a tuple
of two real values representing the roots of a quadratic function, and also a
bool which indicates if the results are valid (e.g. if the function has no
real roots this will be false):</p>

<pre>
<code>
# function which returns a tuple of three values
def roots(a real, b real, c real) (real, real, bool):
    rad = b*b - 4*a*c
    if rad &lt; 0:
        return (0.0, 0.0, false)
    else:
        return ((-b + sqrt(rad)) / 2*a, (-b - sqrt(rad)) / 2*a, true)
</code>
</pre>

<p>When calling this function, we can put the results into a tuple as
follows:</p>

<pre>
<code>
def main():
    # results is the tuple which was returned
    results = roots(1, 0, -16)

    if results[2]:
        print("Roots are ", results[0], " and ", results[1])
    else:
        print("No real roots!")
</code>
</pre>

<p>However, we can "unpack" the tuple right away by assigning the result of the
function call into separate variables:</p>

<pre>
<code>
def main():
    # the tuple is now unpacked
    root1, root2, valid = roots(1, 0, -16)

    if valid:
        print("Roots are ", root1, " and ", root2)
    else:
        print("No real roots!")
</code>
</pre>






<hr />
<h3>Dictionaries</h3>

<p>The last built in data structure in Tetra is the dictionary, which other languages
call associative arrays, hashes or maps.</p>

<p>Dictionaries in Tetra create a dictionary from one set of values (the keys) to another set
(the values).  For example, the following program creates a phone book which
dictionaries names to phone numbers:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# create a dictionary modeling a phone book
def main():
    phone_book = {"alice" : "555-5555", "bob" : "123-4567", "claire" : "765-4321"}
</code>
</pre>

<p>The curly braces contain all elements in the dictionary.  Each element contains the
key (on the left of the colon) and the value (on the right of the colon).  The
elements are separated by commas.</p>

<p>To access the elements of a dictionary, we place the key we want to look up inside
of brackets:</p>

<pre>
<code>
def main():
    phone_book = {"Alice" : "555-5555", "Bob" : "123-4567", "Claire" : "765-4321"}
    print("Bob's phone number is ", phone_book["Bob"]
</code>
</pre>

<p>When declaring the type of a dictionary, such as in a function parameter or return
type declaration, we place the key type and the value type inside of curly
braces, separated by a colon.  For instance, the following function takes a dictionary
from string to int as a parameter which represents the ages of a group of
people and prints them out:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# function which prints the whole dictionary passed in
def print_book(ages {string:int}):
    for person in keys(ages):
        print(person, " is ", ages[person], " years old.")
</code>
</pre>

<p>This function uses the <code>keys</code> function which returns a list of all
of the keys in a dictionary.  This can be used to loop over all of the elements in a
dictionary.</p>




<hr />
<h3>Classes</h3>

<p>Classes in Tetra are created with the class keyword, followed by the name of
the class followed by a colon.  Classes can contain variable declarations.
These declarations must have a type declaration, and cannot be given a
value.</P>

<p>Class blocks can contain also function definitions, which are just like
regular functions except they can reference any variables declared inside of
the class.</p>

<p>For example, the following class represents a square:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# creates a class representing a square shape
class Square:
    # the size of the square
    size real

    # member function to compute the area
    def area():
        return size ** 2
</code>
</pre>

<p>We can create a Square object by using the name of class as if it were a
function which returns an object of that class:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# test out the class
def main():
    s = Square()
    s.size = 5.0
    print("Size = ", s.area())
</code>

<h3>Initializers</h3>

<p>Initializers are functions included in a class with the name
<code>init</code> which allow class objects to be initialized based on certain
parameters.  For instance, we may want to allow the user to pass in the size of
a square when they create one:</p>

<pre>
<code>
class Square:
    # the size of the square
    size real

    # an initializer
    def init(size real):
        self.size = size

    # member function to compute the area
    def area():
        return size ** 2
</code>
</pre>

<p>Notice that the init function uses the <code>self</code> keyword to specify
the size belonging to the object as opposed to the local parameter called
size.</p>

<p>When creating a square object now, we must pass in the size:</p>

<pre>
<code>
def main():
    # now we pass the initializer the size
    s = Square(5.0)
    print("Size = ", s.area())
</code>
</pre>

<p>If any initializers are defined, we must call one of them.  With the class
definition above, we would not be able to forgo supplying the size.  We can
however have multiple initializers with different parameter lists.  Below we
add in a initializer which takes no parameters:</p>

<pre>
<code>
class Square:
    # the size of the square
    size real

    # an initializer with a real parameter
    def init(size real):
        self.size = size

    # an initializer with no parameters
    def init():
        self.size = 0.0

    # member function to compute the area
    def area():
        return size ** 2
</code>
</pre>

<p>Tetra allows multiple functions with the same name in other contexts as well.
We can have regular functions or class member functions with the same names as
long as they have different parameter lists.</p>

<p>Any object can also be assigned the <code>none</code> value which means that
the object does not exist and none of its fields can be referenced.</p>




<hr />
<h3>Modules</h3>

<p>Modules in Tetra allow for packaging related code together.  Each module is
a separate Tetra file.  All code in a module can access the rest of the code in
that same module transparently.  For instance the programs above are each
assumed to be in the same file, so the main functions can call the other
functions in that same file (module) just by name.</p>

<p>We can also write code which accessed code in other modules, but must do so
explicitly.  This is done with either the <code>import</code> or <code>open</code>
keyword.  Each statement is given a module name.  For instance, if we have a
file called "fact.ttr" which contains the following code:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# fact.ttr

def factorial(x int):
    if x == 0:
        return 1
    else
        return x * fact(x - 1)
</code>
</pre>

<p>Then we can access this function from another file called "program.ttr"
which contains a main function using import:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# program.ttr

import fact

def main():
    value = fact.factorial(5)
    print("5! = ", value)
</code>
</pre>

<p>The import statement will fail if the fact.ttr file can not be found, but if
it is found, then all definitions in that file are available.  To access them,
we prefix the reference with the name of the module, as seen above.</p>

<p>The open statement is similar except that it does not require the references
to be prefaced with the name of the module.  We could write the program.ttr
file as follows instead:</p>


<pre>
<code>
# program.ttr

open fact

def main():
    value = factorial(5)
    print("5! = ", value)
</code>
</pre>

<p>We can now call the factorial function directly.  open can be used when there
are no naming conflicts amongst the file(s) being opened, whereas import avoids
any naming conflicts.</p>

<p>When using import or open, Tetra will search in the TETRAPATH environment
variable which should include the Tetra standard library location and also the
current directory, but can include other directories as well.</p>

<p>All Tetra modules can have a main function which is never included when that
module is imported or opened.  The main function is only used when a module is
executed directly.  For example, we could add a main function to the fact.ttr
file which tests out the factorial function.  To test the module, we can run it
directly.  When importing the module, the main is not used and does not conflict
with a main function in the file which is importing fact.</p>

<h3>Function Types</h3>

<p>Tetra also has first-class functions which means that functions can be
passed to and from other functions, stored in variables and data structures
etc.  When declaring a function type, the parameter types are listed in
parentheses, followed by the <code>-&gt;</code> symbol, followed by the return type
of the function.</p>

<p>The following example shows how a function in Tetra can be written which
takes a function as a parameter.  This is done to implement the "reduce" function
of "map reduce" fame:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# just add two numbers
def add(a int, b int) int:
    return a + b

# just multiply two numbers
def mult(a int, b int) int:
    return a * b

# reduce a list to one value using some function
def reduce(data [int], initial int, f (int, int) -&gt; int)) int:
    result = initial
    for d in data:
        result = f(result, d)
    return result

# test out reduce
def main():
    # our data
    data = [1 ... 10]

    # calculate the sum
    sum = reduce(data, 0, add)

    # calculate the product
    product = reduce(data, 1, mult)
</code>
</pre>





<hr />
<h3>Lambda Functions</h3>

<p>Tetra supports lambda functions which are functions created anonymously
inside of an expression.  This can be done to avoid having to define very small
functions.  For instance, we could use a lambda to specify the addition and
multiplication functions directly in the call to reduce:</p>

<pre>
<code>
def main():
    data = [1 ... 10]

    # calculate the sum
    sum = reduce(data, 0, lambda a int, b int: a + b)

    # calculate the product
    product = reduce(data, 1, lambda a int, b int: a * b)
</code>
</pre>

<p>The syntax for a lambda function is shown above.  It begins with the lambda
keyword, followed by the parameter list, then a colon, and then the function
expression.</p>

<p>Lambda functions cannot contain statements or span multiple lines.  If a
larger or more complex function is needed, you must use <code>def</code>.</p>
