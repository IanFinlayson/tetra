<h1>Tetra is...</h1>
<p>A high-level parallel programming language that is designed to make parallel 
programs easy to write, visualize, debug, and optimize. Its goals are to make 
parallel programming easier and more fun to teach and learn.</p>

<hr /> 
<h3>Easy Parallelism</h3>
<p>Tetra includes built-in syntax for writing parallel programs.  Launching
tasks in the background, executing multiple statements in parallel,
parallelizing for loop iterations, and specifying critical sections can all be
done with a single line of code.  This makes writing correct parallel code
easier and less error-prone then in most languages.</p>

<hr />
<h3>Simple Syntax</h3>
<p>The syntax of Tetra is based off of Python which makes it easy to read, and
familiar to most students, as Python is the most popular language for teaching
computer science in the United States.  Tetra inherits most of its structured
and procedural programming concepts from Python, though the language is
different in several ways too.</p>

<hr />
<h3>Strong Type System</h3>
<p>Tetra has a strong, static type system.  All types in Tetra programs are
known at compile time, though the compiler does most of the work for you.
Tetra uses type inference for variables, so the only types you need to manually
declare are function parameter and return types.  All other variables types are
inferred by the compiler giving you the safety of a static type system with
most of the convenience of a dynamic one.</p>

<hr />
<h3>Bundled IDE</h3>
<p>Tetra comes bundled with an IDE which can be used to write, execute and test
Tetra programs.  The IDE includes a debugger which can step through parallel
code.  This makes getting started with Tetra easy for beginning
programmers.</p>
