  <h2>Why Tetra?</h2>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-primary"> <h4>Easy Parallelism</h4> Tetra
includes built-in syntax for writing parallel programs. Launching tasks in the
background, executing multiple statements in parallel, parallelizing for loop
iterations, and specifying critical sections can all be done with a single line
of code. This makes writing correct parallel code easier and less error-prone
then in most languages.  </div>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-primary"> <h4>Simple Syntax</h4> The syntax
of Tetra is based off of Python which makes it easy to read, and familiar to
most students, as Python is the most popular language for teaching computer
science in the United States. Tetra inherits most of its structured and
procedural programming concepts from Python, though the language is different
in several ways too.  </div>



<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-primary"> <h4>Strong Type System</h4> Tetra
has a strong, static type system. All types in Tetra programs are known at
compile time, though the compiler does most of the work for you. Tetra uses
type inference for variables, so the only types you need to manually declare
are function parameter and return types. All other variables types are inferred
by the compiler giving you the safety of a static type system with most of the
convenience of a dynamic one.  </div>


<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-primary"> <h4>Bundled IDE</h4> be used to
write, execute and test Tetra programs. The IDE includes a debugger which can
step through parallel code. This makes getting started with Tetra easy for
beginning programmers.</div>
