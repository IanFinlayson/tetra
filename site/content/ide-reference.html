<h1>IDE Reference</h1>

<p>This page documents the use of the Tetra IDE.</p>


<hr />
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The following image shows the IDE window when you first start it up:</p>

<p>You can either start entering a Tetra program right away or 
open an existing one using "File-&gt;Open", or the "Control-O"
shortcut.</p>

<p>You can open multiple files at once, in which case the IDE
will display them as multiple tabs.</p>



<hr />
<h3>Editing Files</h3>

<p>The Tetra IDE supports typical editing shortcuts such
as undo, redo, cut, copy and paste.  All of these are accessible
from the "Edit" menu, the toolbar, or with standard shortcuts.</p>

<p>The IDE will also automatically indent lines as you type.
By default it uses four spaces for indentation, though this can
be changed in the settings.</p>



<hr />
<h3>Running Programs</h3>

<p>Programs can be run using the "Debug-&gt;Run" option, or the "Control-R"
shortcut.  This will open up a terminal window which you can use to interact
with the running program, as seen below:</p>

<p>When a program finishes, the IDE will report the time that the program
took.  If you wish to stop a program (if it has an infinite loop for instance)
that can be done with the stop button on the toolbar.</p>


<p>The terminal window can also be moved from its default location at the
bottom of the IDE window.  By dragging the top of it, one can position it
on the top, side, or separate it into an independent popup window:</p>

<h3>Settings</h3>

<p>The IDE has a number of settings that can be edited from the
"Edit-&gt;Settings" menu, including the editor font, indentation amount, and
whether line numbers are displayed:</p>

<p>The "Smart Editing" option refers to the IDE's mechanism for automatically
indenting code and letting you indent and de-indent a "level" at a time instead
of as individual spaces.</p>

<p>The settings window also has a tab for changing the syntax coloring
scheme:</p>

<p>You can choose amongst the twelve built-in color schemes, or create
your own.</p>
