- Fix bugs with loops that don't match number of threads...
- Decrease the wait time from 500 to 100 (or so)
- Can we stick threadid into the context, so we don't have to lug it around
  everywhere?
- Clean up the awful num background threads thing - either it's parallel or
  it's not, detecting when it's no longer parallel not worth it
- Also, fix deleting scope when we return from it the last time, we will make
  the scopes ref-counted soon to address that issue.
