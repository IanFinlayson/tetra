Just created x and x = [[5, 5], [5, 5]]
Just entered cally() and q = [[5, 5], [5, 5]]
Just set q[0][0] = 1 and q = [[1, 5], [5, 5]]
Just set q[0][1] = 1 and q = [[1, 1], [5, 5]]
Just set q[1][0] = 1 and q = [[1, 1], [1, 5]]
Just set q[1][1] = 1 and q = [[1, 1], [1, 1]]
Just called cally(x) and x = [[1, 1], [1, 1]]
x[0][0] + x[0][1] + x[1][0] + x[1][1] = 4
