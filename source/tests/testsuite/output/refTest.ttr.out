In main(), just created dd and dd = Len = 1 Elements: {Len = 1 Elements: {Len = 1 Elements: {1}}}
In outer for loop and i = Len = 1 Elements: {Len = 1 Elements: {1}}
In inner for loop and j = Len = 1 Elements: {1}
Just set j[0] = 200 and j = Len = 1 Elements: {200}
dd[0][0][0] = 200
Out of for loop and dd = Len = 1 Elements: {Len = 1 Elements: {Len = 1 Elements: {200}}}
