Just made 'vec' and vec = Len = 5 Elements: {a, b, c, d, e}
Just entered forTest() and par = Len = 5 Elements: {a, b, c, d, e}
i = 0
Just set par[i] = 'qq' and par = Len = 5 Elements: {qq, b, c, d, e}
Just set par[i] = 'q' and par = Len = 5 Elements: {q, b, c, d, e}
i = 1
Just set par[i] = 'qq' and par = Len = 5 Elements: {q, qq, c, d, e}
Just set par[i] = 'q' and par = Len = 5 Elements: {q, q, c, d, e}
i = 2
Just set par[i] = 'qq' and par = Len = 5 Elements: {q, q, qq, d, e}
in the i = 2 block and i = 2
i = 3
Just set par[i] = 'qq' and par = Len = 5 Elements: {q, q, qq, qq, e}
Just set par[i] = 'q' and par = Len = 5 Elements: {q, q, qq, q, e}
i = 4
Just set par[i] = 'qq' and par = Len = 5 Elements: {q, q, qq, q, qq}
in the i > 3 block and i = 4
Just returned from forTest() and vec = Len = 5 Elements: {q, q, qq, q, qq}
vec[2] = 'qq' and vec[4] = 'qq'
