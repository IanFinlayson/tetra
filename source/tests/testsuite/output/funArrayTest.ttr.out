Just created passer and passer = [1, 2, 3]
Just entered cally() and argx = [1, 2, 3]
Just entered caller() and argy = [1, 2, 3]
Just set argy[0] = 10 and argy = [10, 2, 3]
Just set argy[1] = 20 and argy = [10, 20, 3]
Just set argy[2] = 30 and argy = [10, 20, 30]
In cally(), just returned from caller(argx), and argx = [10, 20, 30]
In main, just returned from cally(passer) and passer = [10, 20, 30]
passer[0] + passer[1] + passer[2] = 60
