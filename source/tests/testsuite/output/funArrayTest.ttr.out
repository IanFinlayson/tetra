Just created passer and passer = Len = 3 Elements: {1, 2, 3}
Just entered cally() and argx = Len = 3 Elements: {1, 2, 3}
Just entered caller() and argy = Len = 3 Elements: {1, 2, 3}
Just set argy[0] = 10 and argy = Len = 3 Elements: {10, 2, 3}
Just set argy[1] = 20 and argy = Len = 3 Elements: {10, 20, 3}
Just set argy[2] = 30 and argy = Len = 3 Elements: {10, 20, 30}
In cally(), just returned from caller(argx), and argx = Len = 3 Elements: {10, 20, 30}
In main, just returned from cally(passer) and passer = Len = 3 Elements: {10, 20, 30}
passer[0] + passer[1] + passer[2] = 60
