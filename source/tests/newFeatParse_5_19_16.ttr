# A more robust test file to check parsing for new language features
# that were added May 2016 including:
#   1) declarations without assignment 
#   2) vector ranges that use
#   3) non-literals as endpoints
#   4) types for task, mutex, tuple, and dictionaries
#   5) import and open statements
#   6) functions as arguments and returns
#   7) lambda expressions
