# This document shows the precedence for expressions in Tetra.
# The details are primarily that of Python, and, as such, may contain
#   items that are not yet implemented, and may never be implemented.
# For a fuller description of Python expression precedence, see
#   http://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html
#   especially Section 5.15: Operator precedence

EXPRESSION PRECEDENCE:
# From lowest to highest precedence.
