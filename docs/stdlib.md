### IO

The following functions each take one primitive Tetra type and print it to the
screen.  Eventually Tetra should have overloading of functions which would allow
these to be collapsed into one function.

```python
print_string(s string)
print_int(i int)
print_real(r real)
print_bool(b bool)
```

The following functions each read one primitive value from the user and return
it.

```python
read_string( ) string
read_int( ) int
read_real( ) real
read_bool( ) bool
```
